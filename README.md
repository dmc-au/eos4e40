# Antibiotic activity of small molecules

Based on a simple _E.coli_ growth inhibition assay, the authors trained a model capable of identifying antibiotic potential in compounds structurally divergent from conventional antibiotic drugs. One of the predicted active molecules, Halicin, was experimentally validated _in vitro_ and _in vivo_. Halicin is a drug under development as treatment for diabetes.

# Antibiotic activity of small molecules

Based on a simple _E.coli_ growth inhibition assay, the authors trained a model capable of identifying antibiotic potential in compounds structurally divergent from conventional antibacterial drugs. The model was experimentally validated _in vitro_ and _in vivo_ using Halicin, a molecule under development as treatment for diabetes.

## Summary
